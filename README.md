# futOpt

Example code and [slides](https://github.com/joost-de-vries/futOpt/releases/download/v1.0/Effect.systems.in.Scala.-.beyond.flatmap.pdf) from my talk on effect systems for [Scala Amsterdam + Brabant](http://www.meetup.com/amsterdam-scala/events/222863307/). The code mostly shows the downsides of multiple monad types. 
And derives type class from some ad hoc Future[Option[A]] monad.
